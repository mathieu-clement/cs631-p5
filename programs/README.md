How to run the functions
========================

From the main circuit, you will notice that the Instruction Memory has a File attribute.

Depending on its value, the following files / programs will be executed:

    00      sum_array
    01      find_max
    10      fib_iter
    11      fib_rec

You can find this key in the main circuit.

So first you want to reset the simulation (Simulation -> Reset, or Cmd-R).
Then run the clock ticks until the program green let turns red
